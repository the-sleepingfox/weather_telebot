# weather_telebot
**Hey**, their I made a program that will control the **telegram bot** by usig the python and tell you the current weathor of enterd city.

You can fork and clon the repositery and run into your system but you have to use your own api key collected from telegram @botfather and a weather api_key

First you have to install the libraries first one is "requests" and the second one is "python-telegram-bot"

  `pip install requests`
  
  `pip install python-telegram-bot`
  



the api keys are stored in a python file named as api.py in the following format


  
  >telegram_key = "your_telegram_key_goes_here"
  >
  >weather_key = "your_weather_api_key_goes_here"

know it's ready to run **Thankyou**.
